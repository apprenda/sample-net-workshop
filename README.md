# .NET Workshop Application
Sample .NET Application for use during the Workshop

This application is to be used during the Apprenda workshop to learn how to deploy a .NET application on the platform. 
The application uses standard modern libraries like MVC, Entity Framework and Log4NET. Additionally, there is a SQL Script for DBaaS deployment through the platform. 

The application leverages the Log4NET appender bootstrapper to automatically redirect logs to the Apprenda platform.
